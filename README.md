Project Description: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Project 4: Compute M·Mᵀ using CUDA 
	For a given n×n matrix M of floats, implement an efficient matrix product M·Mᵀ. Note that this 
	operation is included in the Cuda Basic Linear Algebra library (CUBLAS syrk). You should investigate
	whether you can build a better implementation based on our discussions of matrix multiplication and
	the related problem on the midterm exam. For this project be sure to report carefully on your
	implementation and the performance obtained as a function of n. Investigate the behavior as you 
	vary Cuda block and thread parameters. Compare your performance with the Cuda BLAS implementation.
